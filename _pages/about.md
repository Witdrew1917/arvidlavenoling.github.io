My name is Arvid and I'm a second year PhD student at Zenseact (Volvo Cars
subsidiary for autonomous driving software) and Chalmers University of
Technology working on autonomous driving.

My research aims at finding methods for distilling or learning interaction
awareness in learning based prediction and planning for autonomous driving.
