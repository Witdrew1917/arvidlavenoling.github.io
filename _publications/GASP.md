title: "GASP: Unifying Geometric and Semantic Self-Supervised Pre-training for Autonomous Driving"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/GASP
excerpt: 'We learn a unified representation by predicting general occupancy, ego occupancy, and distilled high-level features from a vision foundation model in a continuous 4D field a self-supervised manner. In doing so, we learn representation better aligned for multiple downstream tasks in autonomous driving.'
